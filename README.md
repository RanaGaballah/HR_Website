# HR_Website
 
The project leverages the Django framework, a powerful and popular web development framework written in Python. Django provides a robust set of tools and features for building web applications, including a high-level MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture, an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) for seamless database integration, and a comprehensive routing system for handling URL patterns.  
 
 
The HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files are utilized to create the frontend components of the web application. HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is used to structure the content and define the elements of each web page. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is employed to add styles, layouts, and visual enhancements to the HTML elements, making the web pages visually appealing and responsive.


JavaScript, being a dynamic scripting language, is utilized to add interactivity and dynamic functionality to the web application, such as form validation, dynamic content updates, and AJAX requests.  By combining Django, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the web project offers a comprehensive and feature-rich solution. The Django framework provides a solid backend infrastructure for handling data processing, user authentication, and other server-side functionalities, while the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript frontend elements ensure an engaging and interactive user experience.
